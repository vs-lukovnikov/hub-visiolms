// Styles that deal with transient changes to a component’s appearance. Often, these are client-side changes that occur
// as the user interacts with the page, such as hovering links or opening a modal dialog. In some cases, states are static
// for the life of the page and are set from the server, such as the active element in main navigation.
// The main ways to style state are:
// - Custom classes, often but not always applied via JavaScript.
//   These should be prefixed with .is-, e.g. .is-transitioning, .is-open;
// - pseudo-classes, such as :hover and :checked;
// - HTML attributes with state semantics, such as details[open];
// - media queries: styles that alter appearance based on the immediate browser environment.
